# Team-Registration-Mngt.-by-Google-Form
We have created a google form to collect the roll numbers of students in corresponding teams for mini project in a class

Here we have created a python notebook file which will take the response of the google form as input as well as a .csv file which will contain names of students with their roll number. THis python notebook file will produce a .csv where we will have team's serial number and the team memebers name with their corresponding roll number.
